# Binary-Bomb-Attack-Lab
These are two projects I completed that really dive deep into assembly code and c. The Binary Bomb the assembly code to figure out what is happening in the c code to difuse the bomb, while the attack lab is using exploits to make the program behave a certain way. This introduced me to the ideas of buffer overflow, nop sleds, and address space randomization. Both these projects really helped me understand the importance of security when building software, and how to dive deep into what is happening through the compiler. 

check out the word docs that are attached for the analysis and explanation.
